                    Sir, <br>
                    I beg most respectfully to state that I am a student of your college. My father is a government employee. Recently he has been transfered to Dhaka from here. Our family will be shifted to Dhaka immediately. This is why, it is not possible for me to stay here. Now I need a transfer certificate. <br><br>

                    I therefor, pray and hope that you would be kind enough to issue me a transfer certificate and oblige thereby. <br><br>

                    I remain <br>

                    Dear Sir, <br>
                    We the inhabitants of Rayenda, beg to state that there is no tube-well in our village. So we have been suffering from an acute scarcity of drinking water. Our women have to fatch water from a long distance. Very often we drink impure water from the nearby canals. As a result many fatal diseases like cholera, diarrhoea and other water borne diseas. So the sinking of a tube-well in the village is a crying need. <br><br>

                    May we, therefor, pray and hope that you would be kind enough to pass an order to sink a tube-well in our village. <br><br>

                    Dear Sir, <br>
                    With due respect wi like to draw your kind attention that a devastating flood has recently visited our area and made most of the people homeless, foodless and clothless. Crops are damaged, many people and cattle are washed away. Trees are uprooted. Thousands of people have taken shelter on school, college or embankment. Many disease like cholera, diarrohea, dysentery etc have broken out. The affected people now badly need food, clothes, medicines, pure drinking water etc. <br><br>

                    May we, therefor, pray and hope that you would be kind enough to sanction sufficient relief goods to the flood affected people and oblige thereby. <br><br>

                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As a country Bangladesh is beset with many problems. Price hike is one of them. It has become one of the great problems of our country now. The prices of essential commodities have gone beyond the control of the common people. The prices are not stable. They are increasing by leaps and bounds. The prices of rice, oil, fish, vegetables, baby's milk etc have gone beyond the control of the common people. Now the general people are facing the threat of price hike. Some reasons are responsible for this, Some dishonest businessmen are boarding the daily necessaries. The smugglers and the black marketers are also responsible for this. Some steps need to be taken to keep the price hike inder control. The smugglers must be punished. A bazar monitoring team should be employed in each area.
